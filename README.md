[Abstract "Anything" Theory & Proof Reuse via DTP](http://corp.galois.com/blog/2012/8/21/tech-talk-abstract-anything-theory-and-proof-reuse-via-dtp.html)
==================================================

## Galois Tech Talk ##

How abstractions that appear as type classes (e.g. in
Haskell), behave when extended with propositions in a dependently
typed setting (e.g. in Agda).

Covers depenent records, scoping, equational reasoning, and instance
arguments.

## [Elisp for slide view](https://gist.github.com/3504585) ##

Put your cursor between a comment block (`----`) and use `super-n` (for
next slide) and `super-p` (for previous slide).

Use the import statements on `GTT.agda` as the index.
